# Digital Nomads: Global Lifestyle Rise and Local Impact
## Welcome to our project:
As a special and relatively new group, digital nomads have overlapping characteristics with local residents and tourists, and as their numbers grow after the epidemic, will their presence have any impact on the local community?
In this project, we will delve into the background of digital nomadism, exploring how individuals choose their work and lifestyle and the subsequent impact on local communities and globalization. We will examine how digital nomads are reshaping social citizenship and analyze the controversies surrounding this phenomenon. By closely observing the lifestyles of digital nomads and the various effects they bring, we aim to uncover the profound implications they may have on future societies.
